                    <h4>President</h4>
                    <p>
                      Hard-working, charismatic, trustworthy and joy-spreader -
                      these are some of the words to describe our wonderful
                      President, Hamsika. If it were up to us she would be
                      President of the world. Currently, Hamsika is studying
                      Medicine and Developmental Studies at the University of
                      Oslo. As the president of the association she manages all
                      projects, and has the responsibility of making sure
                      everyone in the board does their part. In addition she is
                      the one who calls the board and the members for meetings
                      and decides the agenda of these meetings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Hamsika’s involvement in the association started in Bergen
                      where she was the vice president of the UN Student
                      Association Hordaland in 2015 before becoming the
                      president in 2016. In January 2017 she moved to Oslo due
                      to her studies. The UN Student Association Oslo was quite
                      inactive when Hamsika arrived Oslo so she decided to do
                      something about it by planning an event for the
                      association that would attract a lot of students, which it
                      did. At the end of the event she held an election, and the
                      current board was elected.

                    <h4>Vice-President</h4>
                    <p>
                      Nothing short of a girl boss, Adela is an inspiration to
                      have on board and gets things done when it is needed. She
                      definitely has a certain remarkable aura about her. Adela
                      is studying Religion Studies, but from a Gender Studies
                      perspective at the University of Oslo. As the
                      vice-president she assists Hamsika in managing the
                      association, and joins her in meetings with organisations
                      we cooperate with. In addition she is an advisor, and
                      helps Hamsika in everything she needs, which includes
                      taking over the role of the president if Hamsika is not
                      present. Lastly, she answers emails and messages from all
                      social media sites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Adela is nothing short of an aspiring philanthropist with
                      previous experience as a refugee guide with integration
                      programmes at Grünerløkka School. For her the importance
                      of being part of something that makes a real change
                      naturally led her to the UN-Student Association Oslo as
                      gender equality, human rights and intersectional feminism
                      are core issues for Adela.

                      Described as a joy-spreader with a positive attitude and
                      charisma, Maria is a great addition to have to have on our
                      team as she brings great energy wherever she goes. Maria
                      is studying International Relations at the University of
                      Oslo with an emphasis on social sciences. Maria’s job is
                      to promote all the events, write some of the texts for the
                      events, and create the events on Facebook. She is also the

                      written all of the texts by herself. In addition she is

                      tackle her role in the organisation. Having grown up in a
