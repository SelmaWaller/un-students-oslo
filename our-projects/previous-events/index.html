                  <h4>UN Student Prize 2018</h4>
                  <p>
                    For the first time in 2018 the UN Student Prize will be
                    awarded to an individual or an organisation that has worked
                    continuously and tirelessly to promote vital global issues.
                    The selected nominees have been chosen due to their
                    dedication to the universal human rights and sustainable
                    development goals, as put forth by the United Nations. The
                    purpose of the UN Student Prize is to recognise the work of
                    these individuals and promoting their efforts, so that they
                    may reach new heights through increased awareness about
                    their work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We welcome you to read more about the nominees and visit
                    their personal website for in-depth information about their
                    work and visions.

              <h2>Crimefight Football</h2>
              <p>
                The volunteer-based project, Crimefight Football (CFF), started
                its journey in 2011 after a group of football enthusiastic boys
                snuck into Plasthallen at Mortensrud and disturbed the Christmas
                Eve of gym-inspector Mario Rinaldi. CFF, which today is run by
                Karar Al-Zayadi, Mario Rinaldi, Thomas Haile, Waled Al-Zayadi
                and Hassan Abdullah, has a membership of about 500 children and
                adolescents aged 11 years and up from various districts in Oslo.
              </p>
              <p>
                The organization which is now in its seventh year, has had a
                strategic long-term plan to prevent juvenile delinquency, which
                often occurs in gangs. Through football and with role models to
                look up too, CFF keep youngsters away from gang-environments and
                crime. The very first youngsters under Crimefight Football are
                said to be the most successful generation at Mortensrud. The
                boys who took an active part in football have now an academic
                background and are making a career for themselves. Not in the
                least, the football evenings throughout the years have
                contributed to reap several professional football players on the
                national and international arena, including Nicolai Næss
                (Heerenveen), Amin Nouri (Vålerenga), Ghayaz Zahid (APOEL) and
                Adnan Haidar (Al-Ansar and the Lebanese National Football Team).
              </p>
              <p>
                In a multicultural district like Søndre Nordstrand, football is
                the common language and an arena connecting children and youth
                across cultures. With its effort and the positive influence on
                children and youth, Crimefight Football is an excellent
                candidate for this year’s UN Student Prize.

                    Stopping climate change and preserving marine life are both
                    UN Sustainable Development Goals. There is no doubt that
                    these concerns are highly relevant in the complex
                    environmental situation the world is in today. Our nominee,
                    Hanna Bauge, is a contributor in both fields with the ocean
                    as her expertise. She is active in the fight against marine
                    littering, both in her work and in her spare time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After surfing waves all around the world and seeing what
                    state the ocean is in, Bauge was inspired to make a change.
                    Today, she works as a Legal Adviser at the Norwegian
                    Directorate of Fisheries, and is a contributor to the Nordic
                    Ocean Watch collective. One of her main tasks is to secure
                    that the aquaculture is done with the environment in mind.
                    With the vision “life in the ocean – our shared
                    responsibility,” Bauge believes that awareness on the field
                    is not only particularly important, but also the biggest
                    challenge in terms of making a change. She also believes
                    that easy steps such as using reusable shopping bags are
                    important moves in the right direction.

                    with great success. The peace accords, give to women a very
                    important role, prioritising their rights and protection as

              <h4>Omar Alshakal</h4>
              <p>
                Since April 2017, the organisation Refugee 4 Refugees has
                supported refugees in their desperate journey towards Europe and
                the forefront of this humanitarian crisis; the shores of Lesvos,
                Greece. The organisation was founded by Omar Alshakal who is a
                24-year-old Syrian refugee. He brings a unique perspective as
                someone who arrived in Europe in 2014, after swimming for 14
                hours from Turkey to Greece. He started the charity to tackle
                the weaknesses of the asylum process, bringing his former
                lifeguard experiences to use in improving boat spotting and
                landing on the South shore of Lesvos.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2017, R4R assisted more than half of the 12 795 people who
                arrived at Lesvos. Additionally, R4R is focusing on helping the
                residents of Moria detention center by hiring a warehouse 200 m
                from Moria, the largest camp on Lesvos which currently holds
                around 6000 people (their capacity is 1800). More than half of
                the residents are living in small tents without access to water
                or sanitation. R4R saw the need to provide a safe space to
                distribute clothes and necessities in a dignified and fair
                matter.
              </p>
              <p>
                The organisation distributes to 250 residents a day and over
                3500 a month. Their vision is to empower and include refugees in
                their work. They believe that this is a way to both integrate
                and ensure that needs are met, as the refugees themselves know
                best what is needed.

              <p>
                Wid Al-Saedy and her family fled to Norway from Iraq as
                political refugees when she was only five years old. Due to her
                background, Al-Saedy relates to refugees who flee from war and
                struggle to integrate into a new society and culture. With an
                increasing focus on the flow of refugees coming to Europe in the
                course of these past few years, it is clear that the challenges
                of integration and inclusion have become more difficult to
                handle.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our nominee, Wid Al-Saedy, has taken this challenge that is at
                the forefront of our society, and opened a volunteer-based
                pop-up hair salon in Tøyen, with the goal of promoting inclusion
                of refugees into the Norwegian society. Drawing from her own
                experience, Al-Saedy has shown great dedication to local issues
                with a wider focus on universal human rights.
              </p>
              <p>
                Her work clearly promotes fundamental principles from the
                Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and shows, in practical
                terms, the importance of equality and inclusion of all people.

                      the world. One of nine people on earth is starving,
