                    <h4>March 19th - 24th</h4>
                    <p>
                      For the first time in history, the UN-Student Association
                      Oslo is organising a one-of-a-kind festival - known as
                      UN-Theme Week 2018: Still Human. With more than 21
                      collaborators and approximately 60 volunteers working
                      actively towards making the festival a reality, the week
                      certainly promises knowledge exchange and enticing
                      dialogue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The UN-Student Association Oslo are honoured to be working
                      alongside UNICEF, UNICEF Norway, The Oslo Center, Nobel
                      Peace Center, Trigger, FOLK!, Red Cross, MSF, Refugee Aid,
                      IUG, Amnesty International, SOS Children's Villages, Save
                      the Children, Norad, FOKUS, YATA Norway, Ministry of
                      Foreign Affairs, Norwegian People's Aid, IOM, UiO, Oslo
                      Metropolitan University. More so, we are proud to announce
                      our close collaboration with Young Sustainable Impact
                      (YSI), FOLK!, Future Leadership Development and Emergence
                      (Project and Process Management Education + DesignStudio)
                      in organising workshops during the week. Our primary goal
                      with organising workshops is to pave the way for young
                      leadership and show how youth can work closely with the UN
                      Sustainable Development Goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A common denominator throughout the week will be our
                      theme, namely "Still Human" - though we will discuss more
                      specific topics that are at the forefront of our global
                      society today. Expand your horizons and take part in an
                      innovative week aimed at challenging the way you think and
                      understand the world around you.

                    <p>
                      Monday March 19th marks the beginning of a beautiful
                      fairytale called UN Theme Week 2018: Still Human! What
                      better way to start such a fairytale than to have several
                      of our partners for this week have their own stalls at
                      Georg Sverdrups hus on Blindern Campus? Here you will find
                      the organizations ready to answer your burning questions,
                      whether it is about UN Theme Week, the organizations’ own
                      goals and visions, or other topics. Do you want to be a
                      volunteer, are you looking for a summer job, are you
                      curious about internships, or do you want to find out if
                      this is your future workplace? Whatever the reason, come
                      and talk with us!

                      Things take a more formal turn in the evening as we have
                      the utmost pleasure to invite you to our welcoming
                      ceremony. We have the honour of arranging the opening of
                      the UN Theme Week at our Nobel Peace Center. They present
                      the winners of the Nobel Peace Prize and their work, as
                      well as the story of founder Alfred Nobel. The center
                      additionally functions as an arena for public debate.
                      Through changing exhibits, guided tours, events,
                      educational and family activities, they hope to stimulate
                      reflection on and engagement with themes such as war,
                      peace and conflict resolution. The Nobel Peace Center has
                      been internationally recognised for its commitment to
                      documentary photography and interactive technology.

                      An unsafe abortion entails interrupting a pregnancy
                      without qualified health care and/or in unsafe and
                      unhygienic surroundings. In the fight for equality and
                      with an increased focus on women’s health globally, access
                      to safe abortions has become a topic that has received
                      increasing attention. What are the biggest challenges of
                      abortions in countries where they are socially stigmatised
                      and punishable by law? What can be done to improve women’s
                      health globally? We welcome you to discuss the issue
                      alongside nurse and midwife Dina Hovland from MSF,
                      Programme Advisor Sissel Thorsdalen from FOKUS Kvinner and

                      Europe is facing the largest flood of refugees since World
                      War II. In the wake of the Arabian Spring and the unrest
                      tied to the fall of regimes, refugees from North Africa
                      and the Middle East have traveled from their homelands to
                      Europe over the Mediterranean Sea. Here rests a collective
                      responsibility both within the EU-integration and in
                      external countries that are affected by the crisis itself.
                      The journey is dangerous, and according to numbers from
                      the International Organization of Migration, more than
                      3563 people lost their lives only in 2015. The
                      disagreements have, amongst other things, created tension
                      in the relationship between the EU and Turkey. To speak on
                      the esteemed topic, we welcome

                      Missing Maps is a project in which volunteers help map
                      buildings in areas that are “missing” from all currently
                      available maps. In Norway, this project is first and
                      foremost done in collaboration with Doctors Without
                      Borders, and the goal is for the doctors to know exactly
                      where the people with the greatest need for medical help
                      are located. This is a simple yet good illustration of how
                      technology and aid can go hand in hand.

                      Have you ever thought about the role the United Nations
                      plays in the global society? This day will be dedicated to
                      discussing UN and its role in tackling heated issues. What
                      are the exact measures being done by the UN to solve
                      climate challenges? What are the greatest climate
                      challenges the UN faces today? What can be improved, and
                      what has worked so far? To discuss this, we will be joined
                      by Senior Energy and Climate Advisor Georg Børsting from
                      the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Senior Researcher Håkon

                      How does the UN handle international conflicts? What are
                      the UN’s biggest challenges? How does the UN reach an
                      agreement to establish peacekeeping operations? How
                      successful and/or problematic have the peacekeeping

                      years after the Kosovo War ended, the UN peacekeeping

                      represent, as well as a short paper on what your country’s
                      position is on the topic. Then it will be up to you to
                      make alliances and further your agenda to the best of your
                      abilities.

                      “The dance is a part of us,” say Samuel Nana Frempong and
                      Prince Omane, the guys who learned how to dance from a
                      very young age and make up the fresh new duo called Samuel
                      X Prince. Join them and shake it off in the evening to
                      conclude an otherwise excellent day.

                      What are the rules of international law, and what happens
                      when a country breaks them? How does war stand in the way
                      of children’s education? And how can their access to
                      education be strengthened? What are the greatest
                      challenges for organisations that work with children’s
                      rights? To answer these questions, we invite Advisor in
                      International Law and Humanitarian Values Øyvin Rannem
                      Lund from Røde Kors, UNICEF (fagansvarlig for Academic

                      Who are the “October Children”? During the 2015 refugee
                      crisis in Europe, many refugees found their way to Europe.
                      Norway received more than 5000 underage asylum seekers.
                      These were children who had no known identity or date of
                      birth, consequently it was decided that their date of
                      birth should be calculated after the day they registered
                      as asylum seekers. The heated issue will be discussed by
                      Special Advisor for Child Refugees Camilla Scharffscher
                      Engeset from Reddbarna, Coordinator for the programme
                      “frivillig assistert retur” Erik Andersson from IOM and
                      Political Advisor Mona Reigstad Dabour from NOAS. The
                      debate will be regulated by Marketing Manager at Norges
                      Fredslag Anneli Setalo.
